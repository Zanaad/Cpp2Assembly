# Cpp2Assembly
### Overview
This project involves the conversion of three different C++ code segments into MIPS Assembly Language, testing the code on both C++ and QtSpim to ensure consistency in output.

### Tasks Completed:
#### Option A: Sorting an Array
In the first task, the C++ code sorts an array of integers using a simple selection sort algorithm. The program prompts the user for input and outputs the sorted array.
#### Option B: Vector Operations

In this task, the C++ code performs several operations on two vectors. It swaps elements between vectors, modifies their contents, and calculates the sum of modified elements.
#### Option C: Sum of Array Elements

In the third task, the C++ code iterates through an array, modifies the array, and calculates two sums: a pre-modification sum and a post-modification sum of its elements.
